==================

TODO:
[4/14/17, 8:43:07 AM] K_M: On the custom tuning in the right hand mode,  the numbers need to be 6th 5th 4th 3rd 2nd 1st
[4/14/17, 8:43:11 AM] K_M: And the left hand tuning needs to be 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th
[4/14/17, 8:43:15 AM] K_M: And this also need to be for the one touch tuning
[4/14/17, 8:46:53 AM] K_M: the standard tuning still need to be reversed in the left handed setting
[4/14/17, 8:48:24 AM] K_M: And whenever a button in the standard tuning is press, the name of that row needs to light up as well
[4/14/17, 8:50:24 AM] K_M: Other than that the green buttons on the tunings need to be touchable


1.0.15 / 2017-04-05
==================

TODO: 
* Also, the fretboard area is too close to the scales and modes option, can you push it further to the right



1.0.12 / 2017-03-30
==================

TODO: 
* [3/30/17, 4:05:00 AM] K_M: There are two small things that need to change on the settings page.
    The left hand / right hand options need to toggle between each other, not work independently of each other

* [3/30/17, 4:08:16 AM] K_M:
      And also change the name of the guitar types from classical to Spanish and from ukulele to Harp.
      And the finger slide is spelled wrong. It is "finger slide" not "figure slider". Everything else looks great
