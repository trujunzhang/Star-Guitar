1.0.12 / 2017-03-30
==================

TODO: 

* [3/30/17, 4:05:00 AM] K_M: There are two small things that need to change on the settings page.
    The left hand / right hand options need to toggle between each other, not work independently of each other

* [3/30/17, 4:08:16 AM] K_M:
      And also change the name of the guitar types from classical to Spanish and from ukulele to Harp.
      And the finger slide is spelled wrong. It is "finger slide" not "figure slider". Everything else looks great
  
1.0.15 / 2017-04-05
==================

TODO: 
* Also, the fretboard area is too close to the scales and modes option, can you push it further to the right
